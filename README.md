## Project Overview

The Dynamic Parking Pricing System is an intelligent, real-time pricing solution designed to optimize parking revenue through automated fare adjustments based on current market conditions, demand patterns, and competitive analysis. The system continuously processes live parking data streams and applies three distinct pricing models to maximize revenue while maintaining competitive market positioning.

### Key Features

### Problem Statement
Traditional parking systems rely on static pricing models, which result in:
- Significant revenue losses during peak demand periods
- Underutilization of parking spaces during off-peak hours
- Lack of competitive market positioning awareness
- Suboptimal customer experience due to pricing inefficiencies
- Inability to adapt to real-time market conditions

### Solution Approach
The system implements an intelligent dynamic pricing framework that:
- Adjusts prices based on real-time occupancy rates and demand patterns
- Considers multiple market factors including traffic conditions, special events, and competition
- Provides transparent pricing logic with comprehensive performance metrics
- Optimizes revenue generation while maintaining customer satisfaction
- Enables data-driven decision making for parking management

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **Parking Sensors**: Real-time occupancy monitoring with timestamp precision
- **Traffic APIs**: Current traffic conditions and congestion levels
- **Event Management Systems**: Special events, holidays, and scheduled activities
- **Weather Services**: Environmental conditions affecting parking demand

#### Data Stream Processing Pipeline
```python
# Pathway Schema Definition
class ComprehensiveParkingSchema(pw.Schema):
    Timestamp: str
    ParkingSpaceID: int
    Occupancy: int
    Capacity: int
    OccupancyRate: float
    QueueLength: int
    TrafficLevel: float
    IsSpecialDay: int
    VehicleType: str
    Latitude: float
    Longitude: float
```

### Pricing Model Architecture

#### Model 1: Baseline Linear Model
**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Price(t+1) = Price(t) + α × (Occupancy/Capacity)
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Purpose**: Provides simple occupancy-based pricing adjustments
- **Parameters**: Base price and adjustment factor (α)
- **Constraints**: Price bounds maintained between 0.5x and 2x base price
- **State Management**: Maintains previous price history for continuity

#### Model 2: Demand-Based Model
**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Demand Score = Σ(Weight_i × Normalized_Factor_i)
Final Price = Base_Price × (1 + λ × Normalized_Demand)
```

**Factor Weights:**
- Occupancy Rate: 40% (primary demand indicator)
- Queue Length: 30% (immediate demand pressure)
- Traffic Level: 20% (external demand influence)
- Special Events: 10% (exceptional demand scenarios)

**Characteristics:**
- **Purpose**: Multi-factor demand analysis with weighted scoring
- **Normalization**: All factors scaled to [0,1] range for consistency
- **Flexibility**: Configurable weights for different market conditions

#### Model 3: Competitive Pricing Model
**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Competitive_Price = Demand_Price × Competitive_Adjustment_Factor
Distance = Haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Purpose**: Location-aware competitive intelligence and pricing
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula for accurate GPS-based distances
- **Competitive Logic**: Dynamic adjustment based on nearby competitor analysis
- **Market Positioning**: Maintains competitive advantage while optimizing revenue

    pricing_data.windowby(
        pw.this.t,
        instance=pw.this.ParkingSpaceID,
        window=pw.temporal.tumbling(timedelta(hours=1)),
        behavior=pw.temporal.exactly_once_behavior()
    )
    .reduce(
        avg_baseline_price=pw.reducers.avg(pw.this.baseline_price),
        avg_demand_price=pw.reducers.avg(pw.this.demand_price),
